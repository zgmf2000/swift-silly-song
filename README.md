# Silly Song 

## Introduction
This application is created as the final project from "Swift for Developers" free course by Udacity (link [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/swift-for-developers--ud1025)).

This is a basic app which takes a user input (presumably their name) then transforms that name into a song with pre-defined lyric template.

## How To Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the project (the file with **.xcodeproj** extension).
3. Build the project and run the app.
